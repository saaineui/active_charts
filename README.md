# ActiveCharts

Beautiful, easy charts for ActiveRecord and Rails.

ActiveCharts is a charting toolset that integrates into ActiveRecord and ActionView for fast, easy business intelligence and data visualization on any Rails app. 

ActiveCharts uses inline SVG wherever possible for simplicity and best performance on the web. Javascript is used only when absolutely necessary.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'active_charts'
```

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
